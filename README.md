# e-conomics-case

This repository contains all the files for the Data Scientist position case from e-conomics.
The code is written in Matlab. The main file is the prediction_model.mat.

There are three data .mat files that contains the final models for all the 100 companies, the test results, and the order of the 100 companies respectively.

In addition to this there is an Excel file that contains the test results paired with their respective company, the number of datapoints related to the specific company, and the percentage of the entire dataset that is represented with this company.

There is also a Word document that contain my notes regarding part 1 and part 2 of the case.
